# The Ideas #

  * some 2d-inter/extra-polating function function z\_shift(x,y), generated by some probe-locations, to compensate for non-flat surfaces.
  * Also, by defining a z value that borders save moves from cutting moves, and using g0, one could split the code into junks, and optimize by some traveling salesman-algorithm.
  * Parsing of expressions would also be useful.
  * Arcs could be split into small linear moves to scale scale differently in x and y.
  * Unnecessary intermediate stops could be thrown away. e.g. X0 Y0  X1 Y0  X2 Y0->X0 Y2, based on some accuracy goal.
